## Getting Started

### Setup the Project

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:marcossevilla/compass_app.git
cd compass_app
```

2.  Install Flutter and Dart

Ensure you have the Flutter SDK and Dart SDK installed. You can follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Make sure you have the project's current version by checking the app package's [pubspec.yaml](https://github.com/marcossevilla/compass_app/tree/main/packages/app/pubspec.yaml#L8) file.

3.  Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Project Structure

Our monorepo is structured as follows:

```
compass_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/          # Flutter application package
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...   # Application code
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...   # Application tests
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/          # Dart API package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...   # API code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...   # API tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pubspec.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ pubspec.yaml  # Root pubspec (for monorepo setup)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

* **`app/`:** Contains the Flutter application code, UI, and business logic.
* **`api/`:** Contains the Dart API package, defining backend logic.

## Making Changes

### Branching

```bash
git checkout -b feature/[your-feature-name] # or bugfix/[your-bug-name]
```

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the purpose of your changes.

### Coding Standards

* **Dart Style Guide:** Follow the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
* **Flutter Style Guide:** Adhere to the Flutter style guide and best practices.
* **Consistent Formatting:** Use `flutter format` to ensure consistent code formatting.
* **Analyze your code:** Use `flutter analyze` to catch any potential issues.

### Testing

* **Write Tests:** Ensure your changes are covered by appropriate unit, widget, and integration tests.
* **Run Tests:** Run all tests before submitting a pull request:

```bash
flutter test
```

* **Test Coverage:** Aim for 100% test coverage as the minimum requirement.

### Documentation

* **Document Public APIs:** Add clear and concise documentation for all public APIs in all the packages (except for `app`).
* **Update README:** If your changes introduce new features or modify existing ones, update the `README.md` accordingly.
* **Inline Comments:** Add inline comments to explain complex logic or decisions.

### Committing Changes

* **Atomic Commits:** Make small, logical commits that each represent a single change.
* **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Use clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes. Follow the Conventional Commits specification.

```
feat: add new feature [feature name]
fix: fix bug [bug name]
